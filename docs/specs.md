# Assignment 1: User Interface Layout

## Overview
 
You are to create a new project and replace main.dart with the supplied main.dart as a starting point, then add your code to the supplied main.dart file to complete the task, and finally submit only your completed main.dart file to Moodle.

## Required Tasks

### Part 1:

- Create a new project and replace main.dart with your code.

- Create a Material Widget with a Scaffold. In the body of the Scaffold start with a Row Widget.

- All you will need is the `row`, `column` and `container` widgets, and any other widgets that are associated with the aforementioned widgets.
 
- Do `NOT` use the `stack` or `positioned` widgets.

- All containers will have a height and width of 100px.

- All font sizes will be default except `Con 6` which will be font size 30.

- All borders will have a width of 3px. Be careful because some elements do not have a border.

- All padding will be 10px. Be careful because some elements do not have padding.

- The easiest solution is to have 1 row with 3 columns as children of the row.

### Part 2

- Compile and run your program in a Virtual Phone. Your program must look very similar to the screen shot below.

- When you are happy with your solution, submit only your completed main.dart file to Moodle.
